Yet Another Kossel - design based on Wolfmanjim's Wolfstock derivative of Kossel, mine uses OpenBeam and Open Rail instead of Mitsumi stuff.

It looks like a side length of 475mm will minimize the waste of 1m sticks of OpenBeam.

Vertical structure is OpenBeam with double OpenRail, 4 delrin wheels (2 adjustable) and a 20mm gantry plate.
